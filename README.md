# Introducing Mimo
### An ambient person assistant crafted for older adults

The population of older adults in America is increasing faster than ever — and over 90% of them are choosing to live alone. 
Mimo adds an ambient personal assistant to their lives that they can always talk to by creating an environment of companionship and emotional support. Our vision was to create an assistant so intelligent it responds to your voice. One so immersive, the technology itself disappears into the experience, and empowers users to do more with their voice.

### Features

**1. Tackle your daily events with confidence**

Get control of your surroundings simply by using your voice. Mimo is an always-on, always-listening, hands-free personal assistant that will always be there for you to accomplish and make sense of things most important to you.

**2. Make sense of your well-being**

Mimo comes with a variety of skills that enhance what Alexa can do. You can be more informed by asking Alexa things like how many calories your salad has, what your blood pressure means, and be reminded to stand up every so often.

**3. Forgetting is now a thing of the past**

By using both your voice and sight, Mimo can actively inform you about the events in your calendar. The mirror keeps you more informed and aquainted about your daily activities. You can now see what’s coming up even before you ask.

**4. An assistant designed and centered around you**

We understand that people comprehend information at different speeds, so with Mimo, you can adjust Alexa's rate of speech to reflect your pace. We've also built in a standard double-confirmation speech to make your interactions more accurate.

**5. Enrich your life by adding more skills**

With Mimo, you can now learn to add more natural and intuitive skills that fit into several aspects your life. Simply ask Alexa for help, and see the top skills that people are using.

### Our Demographic

We saw Capstone as an opportunity to create an experience for a 
demographic that is often overlooked -- older adults. 


While technology continues to evolve, it becomes harder for 
us to adapt to new affordances it presents. It takes time and 
effort for us to calibrate ourselves to take full advantage of 
new solutions. This creates a gap between what we can do, 
and what’s possible. 

Older adults are no different, except, these gaps get wider for 
them each day. Getting older and living alone contribute in 
creating health and technical barriers. 

### Voice is the primary User Interface for Mimo

With Mimo, we envisioned to create an experience that uses your voice to 
communicate with technology and get things done. 

This was crucial to implement because it involved the least amount of familiarity 
with technology, especially for older adults. Technology must deliver incredible 
capbility without the complexity. This idea was the founding principle for Mimo. 

Talking to Mimo is now an easier, faster way to get things done. It’s always with 
you — in your living room — ready to help throughout your day. With a redesigned 
interface and new, more adjustable voice, Mimo is more powerful than ever. 

We believe that technology is at its best, its most empowering, when it simply disappears.
