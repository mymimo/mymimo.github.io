# Introducing Mimo
### An ambient person assistant crafted for older adults

The population of older adults in America is increasing faster than ever — and over 90% of them are choosing to live alone. 
Mimo adds an ambient personal assistant to their lives that they can always talk to by creating an environment of companionship and emotional support. Our vision was to create an assistant so intelligent it responds to your voice. One so immersive, the technology itself disappears into the experience, and empowers users to do more with their voice.
