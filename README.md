# Introducing Mimo
### An ambient person assistant crafted for older adults

The population of older adults in America is increasing faster than ever â€” and over 90% of them are choosing to live alone. 
Mimo adds an ambient personal assistant to their lives that they can always talk to by creating an environment of companionship and emotional support. Our vision was to create an assistant so intelligent it responds to your voice. One so immersive, the technology itself disappears into the experience, and empowers users to do more with their voice. 

### Features

1. Tackle your daily events with confidence

Get control of your surroundings simply by using your voice. Mimo is an always-on, always-listening, hands-free personal assistant that will always be there for you to accomplish and make sense of things most important to you.

2. Make sense of your well-being

Mimo comes with a variety of skills that enhance what Alexa can do. You can be more informed by asking Alexa things like how many calories your salad has, what your blood pressure means, and be reminded to stand up every so often.
